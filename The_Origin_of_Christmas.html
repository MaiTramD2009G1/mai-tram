						<p class="col-md-6">During the early Christian Church (first 2-3 centuries C.E.), this feast was celebrated in conjunction with the Epiphany. However, as early as the year 200, Saint Clement of Alexandria (150 - 215) spoke of a very special feast celebrated on May 20. And the Latin Church celebrates this feast on December 25.<br><br>
						According to another source, early Christians did not celebrate birthdays, because they believed that celebrating birthdays was following the custom of pagan idolatry. Therefore, they did not celebrate the Nativity of Jesus during the first three centuries. It wasn't until the 4th century that Christians began to want to celebrate the Christmas of Jesus once a year, but they were afraid of being discovered and persecuted by the Roman authorities because at that time Christianity was still a not yet recognized as a legitimate religion.</p>
						
						<p class="pb-5 px-3"> However, the Romans, every year celebrated the "Sun God" who brought light to the world on December 25. So Christians took advantage of this occasion to celebrate the birth of Jesus. and brought light and life to mankind on the same day as the Roman "Sun God" holiday. Therefore, the Roman government did not discover that Christians celebrated the Christmas of Jesus.<br><br>
						In 312, Roman Emperor Constantine abandoned Polytheism and converted to Christianity. It was he who canceled the celebration of the "Sun God" and instead celebrated the birthday of Jesus. In 354, Pope Liberius proclaimed December 25 as the official date to celebrate the Nativity of Jesus.<br><br>
						Throughout the centuries, Christian chroniclers have accepted Christmas as the day Jesus was born. However, by the early 18th century, scholars began to propose a different explanation. Accordingly, Isaac Newton suggested that Christmas day was chosen to correspond to the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, which was once marked as December 25.<br><br>
						In 1743, a German named Paul Ernst Jablonski argued that the date of Christmas was determined to be December 25 to match the date of Sol Invictus in the ancient Roman religion.</p>
